# Memory Management Learning Tool: Immersive 3D OS Education
A design-thinking-led platform for mastering Memory Management and Virtual Memory techniques.

Team Members: Krupa P Nadgir, Lekhana A, Manaswini Simhadri Kavali

## Overview

Understanding how an Operating System manages memory is often a hurdle for Computer Science students due to the abstract nature of the concepts. This project provides a static web platform that transforms these abstractions into interactive 3D models and hands-on modules. Built using a human-centered design approach, the tool allows users to visualize and practice complex scenarios like hierarchical paging and demand paging in an engaging environment.

## Key Learning Modules

* Paging & Segmentation: Visualize how processes are divided and loaded into non-contiguous memory frames.

* Address Translation: Practice the mechanics of mapping logical addresses to physical addresses using page tables.

* Hierarchical Page Tables: Explore the structure and efficiency of multi-level paging systems.

* Virtual Memory: Understand Demand Paging and Page Allocation policies through real-world simulations.


## Development Methodology

The platform was developed following a strict Design Thinking framework:

1. Empathy & Define: Identifying common student pain points in OS courses through stakeholder engagement.

2. Ideation: Brainstorming 3D visualization techniques to represent memory frames and pages.

3. Prototyping: Building interactive modules that allow for iterative user testing and feedback.

4. Testing: Refining the UI/UX based on learner performance and clarity of the 3D models.
